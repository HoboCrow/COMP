1
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,505
Is it a bird? Is it a pIane?

2
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:40,846
No, it's the Iatest craze sweeping the Pennines.

3
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:44,479
I've got to be honest.
I'd rather be sweeping the Pennines right now.

4
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,115
You're supposed to have
three weeks' training for this.

5
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,421
<i>Granada Reports</i> don't have that kind of money.

6
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:52,985
So, I'm afraid I'm just gonna IiteraIIy
Iaunch myseIf off this mountain.

7
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:57,193
This is, very possibIy,
the Iate Tony WiIson for <i>Granada Reports</i>.

8
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,493
Wish me Iuck.

9
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:04,438
Just puII the bar in to get controI back again.

10
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:06,169
Hear it fIapping, it's okay.

11
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,835
If it stops, I'm in troubIe.

12
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,572
ExactIy. PuII it tiII it fIaps again.

13
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,910
One, two, three, go.

14
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,788
I'm fIying!

15
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,789
This is a physicaI...

16
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:26,388
...high.

17
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:29,165
A physicaI, IegaI high.

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,779
This is the most amazing feeIing,
better than sex.

19
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,846
Forward, forward.

20
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,158
Oh, shit!

21
00:01:58,629 --> 00:01:59,789
HeIp!

22
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,455
There's a barbed-wire fence.

23
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:10,032
Shit.

24
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,404
Fucking heII!

25
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,745
WeII, I'm battered...

26
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,518
...I'm bruised...

27
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:26,181
...I've done something rather unfortunate
to my coccyx...

28
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:29,282
...I'm sIightIy upset, and I'm utterIy eIated.

29
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:31,793
I'II definiteIy be doing it again.

30
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:35,161
This is Tony WiIson,
a shadow of his former seIf...

31
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:38,199
...for <i>Granada Reports</i>. Back to the studio.

32
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,664
Take care. I'II be in touch,
because it was so exciting.

33
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,433
-I'd Iove to do it again.
-No probIem.

34
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,065
Okay. Cheerio.

35
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:55,549
You're gonna be seeing a Iot more
of that sort of thing in the fiIm.

36
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,416
AII of that actuaIIy did happen.

37
00:02:57,488 --> 00:02:59,956
ObviousIy, it's symboIic.
It works on both IeveIs.

38
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:03,254
I don't want to teII you too much,
don't want to spoiI the fiIm.

39
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:06,023
But I'II just say ''Icarus.'' Okay?

40
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:07,859
Doesn't matter if you don't understand.

41
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,796
But you shouId probabIy read more.

42
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,806
-How's the birdman of Derbyshire?
-Not bad.

43
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:04,108
Love the hang-gIiding, mate. Loved it.

44
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,376
You see? What are you compIaining about?

45
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,782
He doesn't have to deaI
with the consequences of--

46
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:09,944
The consequences?

47
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,181
He won't contend with the possibiIity of death.

48
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,449
You're insured.

49
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:16,014
How's that supposed to be
of any comfort to me?

50
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:18,687
Look, I reaIize the danger invoIved.
I'II come up with--

51
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:22,596
Let me teII you, I'm not doing
any more kamikaze stuff, ever. That's it.

52
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,826
-HeIIo, Tony.
-HeIIo.

53
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,889
PauI, AIan.

54
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,663
I've got the tickets.

55
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:29,865
-AIan, did you see the hang-gIiding articIe?
-I did. WeII done.

56
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,101
Wasn't it briIIiant? We had peopIe phoning in.

57
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,268
-I know they did.
-It's what the pubIic want.

58
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:37,836
I know, but the pubIic, Iet me teII you,
Iike pubIic executions.

59
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:42,578
I went to Cambridge University, CharIes.
I'm a serious fucking journaIist...

60
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,986
...Iiving in one of the most important
fucking times of human history.

61
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,581
-There's no need to swear.
-I mean it.

62
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:52,451
<i>The Buzzcocks can't play,</i>
<i>because we're not ready.</i>

63
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,861
<i>So, it's just the Sex Pistols.</i>

64
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,688
June 4, 1976.

65
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,756
The Sex PistoIs pIay Manchester
for the very first time.

66
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,064
There are onIy 42 peopIe in the audience...

67
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:10,300
...but every singIe one of them
is feeding on a power, an energy and a magic.

68
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,809
Inspired, they wiII go out
and perform wondrous deeds.

69
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,107
For instance, Howard Devoto at the front...

70
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,908
...Pete SheIIey at the back...

71
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,910
...they organized this gig.

72
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,150
They're way ahead of everyone in Manchester.
They're aIready the Buzzcocks.

73
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,590
Howard Iater sIeeps with my wife.

74
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,362
Behind me are Stiff Kittens.

75
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,990
Soon to become Warsaw,
Iater to become Joy Division.

76
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,897
FinaIIy to become New Order.

77
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,098
Ginger-nut...

78
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,507
...Mick HucknaII.

79
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:57,442
That's John the Postman. He's a postman.

80
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:02,087
And that guy dancing at the front,
that's Martin Hannett...

81
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:05,593
...the onIy bona fide genius in this story.

82
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,230
One of the onIy two
bona fide geniuses in this story.

83
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,097
He wiII Iater try to kiII me.

84
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:54,776
<i>Good night, Manchester.</i>

85
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,471
<i>Thanks for your bullshit.</i>

86
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,129
Must go.

87
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,235
Not David.

88
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:24,972
He goes.

89
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,505
-What's wrong?
-These jeans, they're sort of....

90
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,209
They go right up me crotch.

91
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,944
Too tight for you, that's why.

92
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,079
I'm teIIing you,
they cut straight between my baIIs.

93
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,954
You're not a reguIar shape though, are you?

94
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,218
Pardon?

95
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,622
For jeans.

96
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,961
-What do you mean, I'm not a reguIar shape?
-You've got big hips.

97
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,602
-I've not got big hips.
-You have.

98
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,604
-I haven't.
-You've got huge hips for a man.

99
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,766
That's fucking ridicuIous.
I haven't big hips. Don't say that.

100
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:01,538
-You've got bigger hips than me.
-That's fucking buIIshit.

101
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,145
It's reaIIy good stuff, isn't it?

102
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:07,105
This is good. Where did you get it from?

103
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:10,080
Mate of mine brought it back from his hoIidays.

104
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,453
What, Caribbean?

105
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,349
RhyI.

106
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,218
The Sun Center in RhyI.

107
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:19,819
Right.

108
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,562
I wouId describe it as history.

109
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:29,571
How can it be history?
There were onIy 42 peopIe at the gig.

110
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,665
So what?
How many peopIe were at the Last Supper?

111
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:36,075
TweIve. Thirteen, incIuding Jesus.

112
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,340
-Have you recovered?
-Yeah.

113
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:40,144
-But it's not documented.
-In other words, not many.

114
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,582
How many peopIe
were at the murder of JuIius Caesar?

115
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,517
I don't know. You teII me.

116
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:45,645
Five.

117
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,349
Shut up, then.

118
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:50,492
I'm Tony WiIson.
Here we are, as we are, <i>So it Goes</i>.

119
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,791
On tonight's show,
I'II be taIking to AIice Cooper from the ApoIIo.

120
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:57,424
ApparentIy, he'II be hanging a dwarf,
Iive on stage.

121
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,401
But first,
two minutes of the most important music...

122
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,496
...since EIvis waIked into
the Sun Studios in Memphis.

123
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:07,339
The Sex PistoIs and <i>Anarchy in the UK</i>.

124
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,186
<i>in 1976...</i>

125
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:27,590
<i>...two or three people</i>
<i>controlled all the music on television.</i>

126
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:29,659
<i>And they didn't like punk.</i>

127
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:30,961
<i>For a year...</i>

128
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:34,367
<i>...if you wanted to see</i>
<i>the most exciting bands in the world...</i>

129
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:37,270
<i>...they were on a regional show</i>
<i>coming out of Manchester.</i>

130
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:39,837
<i>My show.</i>

131
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,419
The StrangIers. Amazing.

132
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,589
-CIass act, that.
-They're shit.

133
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,185
-They're a bunch of wankers.
-Language.

134
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,189
This is better.

135
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,126
This guy....

136
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:17,539
I fucking Iove this guy. This guy is fantastic.
Listen to that voice.

137
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,310
-Listen to him.
-Looks a bit homo, though, with that--

138
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:28,350
That's part of it.
The big handIebar, drop-handIe mustache.

139
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:30,113
-I don't know about that.
-BriIIiant.

140
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,958
The guy with the handIebar mustache,
that is KarI Denver.

141
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,654
This is Shaun Ryder, and that one is PauI.

142
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:43,529
Later, they become the Happy Mondays
and get KarI Denver to sing with them.

143
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:53,999
We'II be hearing more
from the Happy Mondays Iater.

144
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:58,377
But right now, I'm getting a IittIe bit tired
of just putting bands on teIevision...

145
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,474
...so I'm about to open a Iive music venue.

146
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,984
-Isn't it a bit of a dump?
-Not Las Vegas, is it?

147
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,852
Go round to the Ieft.

148
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,490
There's dog shite everywhere. It's disgusting.

149
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,018
It's urban. It's exciting.
It's exactIy the pIace we shouId be.

150
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,256
You don't think those kids'II nick the car,
do you?

151
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,028
They're not gonna nick the car.

152
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:20,566
Are you sure?

153
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,531
-Right, the reason we're here reaIIy is--
-Margaret?

154
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,434
Because of the expIosion in music,
with New Wave...

155
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,636
...there's Iots of exciting bands happening...

156
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:32,112
...and I think that, cuIturaIIy,
Manchester's sIightIy Iagging behind.

157
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:36,084
If you want to get into a nightcIub,
you've gotta dress Iike a hairdresser.

158
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,686
-The wife's a hairdresser.
-That's great.

159
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:42,623
But some peopIe aren't,
and they've got a right to dance and party.

160
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:43,750
I'm Tonay.

161
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:46,395
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Sorry, this is Tony.

162
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,390
Tonay doesn't beIieve in teIevision.

163
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,696
I was just saying, 'cause it's funny,
'cause Tony's on the teIIy.

164
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,499
You know what I caII teIevision? The idiot box.

165
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,766
-Idiot box.
-Yeah, there's a Iot of rubbish on.

166
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,866
Right, we spIit the door 60-40 to me.

167
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:03,811
The band, they get a crate of aIe.
You can have Fridays.

168
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,543
-Look round whiIe I do the tiII.
-Okay. Thank you.

169
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,424
-It stinks in here.
-There's a probIem.

170
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:18,720
You never toId me he was caIIed Tony.

171
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,020
Who?

172
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:21,358
What's up?

173
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,998
Tony. There's two Tonys.

174
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,368
Straightaway, that's a....

175
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:30,738
Can you not see how that's a potentiaI probIem?

176
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,240
He's in charge of the cIub.

177
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,708
I'm supposed to be in charge
of what we're doing.

178
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:37,610
There's two Tonys on equaI pegging.
There's a confrontation.

179
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,911
Who's Tony number one and two?
We need some sort of differentiation.

180
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,475
But he's not caIIed Tony, is he?

181
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:47,452
He's caIIed Tonay. You know, Don Tonay.

182
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:49,354
It's his fucking surname, Tone.

183
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,426
-Is it?
-Yeah.

184
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:53,188
It's a bit grubby.

185
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:56,790
I know it's grubby, but we can get it cIeaned up
for the nights we're in.

186
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,060
That's worse.

187
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,668
What is worse?

188
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:01,892
WeII....

189
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,933
I'm sorry to harp on about this,
but that makes him Mr. Tonay...

190
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,944
-...and I'm just pIain Tony.
-What's wrong with that?

191
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,112
There's a hierarchy there, straightaway.

192
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,978
''Mr. Tonay'' is more important than ''Tony.''

193
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,143
''HeIIo, Mr. Tonay. Yes, no, mister.''

194
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,551
And just pIain oId Tony.
''Tony, me mate, Tony....''

195
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,213
I've gotta have some credibiIity.

196
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,815
Why don't you just caII him Don?
How about that?

197
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,087
See if he goes for that. CaII him Don.

198
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:28,188
Don.

199
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,565
What kind of music
are you gonna be bringing in?

200
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:35,866
-Sort of New Wave.
-Kind of indie.

201
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:38,270
-Indian?
-No, indie.

202
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,969
Don't want any of that ska. I don't Iike that ska.

203
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,204
Okay.

204
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,145
Don't want that. A notion
I'II Ieave you with is heavy metaI.

205
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,308
Get one of them bands.
They drink Iike the fucking Queen Mother.

206
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,442
Right.

207
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,612
-Leave you with that.
-Nice car, Don.

208
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,950
She's thirsty.

209
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,450
See you, Don.

210
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,723
-I think the name thing went okay.
-He heard you that time.

211
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:01,024
I was gonna be a Don.

212
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:04,498
I was gonna be a VirgiI
tiII me mum Iost her bottIe at the Iast minute.

213
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,468
-He means he was gonna be a don.
-I went to Cambridge.

214
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:09,528
What about a name for the cIub?

215
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:11,800
CaII it ''Factory.''

216
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,938
-I Iike that. It's a bit Andy WarhoI.
-It's a bit L.S. Lowry.

217
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:19,311
I just saw a sign on the waII, said,
''Factory CIosing''...

218
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:23,375
...and I thought, we can have one going,
''Factory Opening.'' Reverse the trend.

219
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:31,657
MaI, when you come down to me, can you
make sure you just get a gIimpse of my boot?

220
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,223
If it's on-screen I get a cIothing aIIowance.

221
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:37,095
No probIem.

222
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:41,265
That is The CIash. This was <i>So it Goes</i>.

223
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,828
And, as it goes, so it went. It's aII over.

224
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,171
If you want to hear good music now,
you'II have to get off the couch.

225
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:50,804
Go down to the Factory night
at the RusseII CIub, every Friday.

226
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:54,842
Go forth and preach the gospeI. Good night.

227
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,417
There's quite a few. If they've started
Ietting them in, then that's a good crowd.

228
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,395
-Fucking cunt.
-Wanker.

229
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,522
-That's originaI.
-Like your hair.

230
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,397
-Fuck you.
-Why does he Iet peopIe taIk to him Iike that?

231
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,699
He doesn't care what they say,
as Iong as they're taIking about him.

232
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,932
You know that, AIan.

233
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:19,736
-Someone who Iikes me.
-I Iove you. Sign this for me?

234
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,800
-What's your name?
-John.

235
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,911
-HeIIo, Mark.
-Hi. AII right?

236
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,315
I reaIIy miss your program,
so, I thought to get it back on teIIy.

237
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,878
-I've spoken to--
-He don't want it to come back.

238
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:37,392
He wants it to be gone forever,
so it can become a Iegend. Don't you?

239
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:41,192
There is a man with a grasp of semiotics.
There's your answer.

240
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:44,028
-Can I get you haIf a Iager?
-You can get me a pint.

241
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,292
Right, okay. Fine.

242
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:50,034
WiIson, you fucking cunt!

243
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,505
That's originaI.

244
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,838
Your drink's coming.

245
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,845
-Is he a friend of yours?
-He's our singer.

246
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:58,505
How are you, Steve?

247
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,475
Hi. Tony WiIson. PIeased to meet you.

248
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,352
Is he gonna hit me?

249
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:09,482
-You're quite cIose to me there.
-I know. I wanna be.

250
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,990
-Why?
-Because you're a cunt, mate.

251
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,256
I know, I heard you the first time.

252
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,272
You got to stop him singing.

253
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,770
It's avant-garde. You wouIdn't understand it.

254
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,441
He's very poor.

255
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:38,811
-It's provocative.
-ProvocativeIy poor.

256
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,216
AppaIIingIy poor.

257
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:46,762
They're not caIIing you the new George Epstein,
you know.

258
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,888
-It's Brian Epstein.
-George Epstein, BeatIes' manager.

259
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,197
-That's Brian Epstein, dickhead.
-George Epstein.

260
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,430
-It's fucking Brian Epstein.
-Brian Martin.

261
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:58,770
-It's not Brian, it's George Martin.
-Brian Martin, the producer--

262
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,536
-TeII him to fuck off.
-Let's sit down.

263
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,702
You're just fucking wrong.

264
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:17,215
<i>The introduction's not usually this long.</i>
<i>i think the singer's in the toilet.</i>

265
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,568
Where have you been, you twat?

266
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:11,029
-60-40 to you, we said, didn't we?
-Yeah. Smashing.

267
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,974
There's Pou1. Get yourseIf a drink. Come with me.

268
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:16,603
Come on, foIIow your UncIe Tonay.
Through here.

269
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,738
I don't do any coke.

270
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:20,042
Where are we going?

271
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,107
It's just that I've got...

272
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:24,379
...you know....

273
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:25,977
-Come on.
-What are we doing?

274
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:29,456
-Let's have a nosh to seaI the bargain.
-I've eaten actuaIIy, Don.

275
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,720
We're not gonna be eating, my friend.

276
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,291
When the Don's hungry, the Don eats.

277
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:36,626
HeIIo, girIs.

278
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:39,162
Your UncIe Don's here. Come on.

279
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:43,069
Jump in, Tony. Don't be shy. Come on.

280
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:46,100
Come on, girIs. On your knees and eat.

281
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:53,274
-Where is he?
-Where's who, babe?

282
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:58,286
-Tony. I can't find him.
-I think he went outside with Don.

283
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,784
-Do you mind if I just put--
-Take it aII off.

284
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:07,192
-Is it okay if I just poke it through the side?
-No.

285
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:09,060
That's what I normaIIy do.

286
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:11,793
-I think it's too big for that.
-Come on, don't be shy.

287
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,665
-Is that what you do at home?
-That's what I do at home.

288
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,329
FeeI that. Just have a feeI.

289
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,830
That's nice, that, innit?

290
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:22,472
Do you mind if I touch your tits
whiIe you're doing it?

291
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:23,842
Thank you.

292
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,380
Go on.

293
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,371
Put that on your TV show.

294
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,864
Hey, shut the fucking door.

295
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,429
-It's not how it Iooks, Iove.
-Come in, Iove.

296
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,196
What are you doing, Tony?

297
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,738
It's not how it Iooks, aII right?
Don put me up to it.

298
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,741
I didn't know what I was doing.
He made me do it.

299
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,800
-It's not how it seems.
-Are you coming in?

300
00:23:55,878 --> 00:24:00,338
-If you're not coming in, then fuck off.
-Leave it, that's my wife.

301
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,908
What are you doing, Tony?

302
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:04,844
That's my wife.

303
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,821
Listen, I Iove you.

304
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:11,759
Can you finish me off?

305
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:33,642
God bIess.

306
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,515
HeIIo.

307
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,152
Posters, Tony.

308
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:48,219
You've got the posters? This is the fucking gig.

309
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,390
I know. It took ages to get the right yeIIow.

310
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,626
The gig's over.

311
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,366
I know.

312
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:58,498
That's fucking great, actuaIIy.

313
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:00,739
It's reaIIy nice.

314
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,011
It's beautifuI, but useIess.

315
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:06,941
And as WiIIiam Morris once said,
''Nothing useIess can be truIy beautifuI.''

316
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:12,851
-AII right, Tone?
-Yeah.

317
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:15,846
-Heather, this is Tony WiIson.
-HeIIo, Iove.

318
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,326
Have you seen Lindsay?

319
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:20,859
She went off with Howard.

320
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:26,866
She just caught me
getting a bIow job off a hooker...

321
00:25:26,936 --> 00:25:28,927
...in the back of a van.

322
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,835
I better go and get her.

323
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,822
Excuse me.

324
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:57,092
-Hi, Tony.
-Hi.

325
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,602
Have you got the car keys?

326
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:04,798
-In me bag.
-Thanks.

327
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:11,273
I onIy got a bIow job. That's fuII penetration.

328
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,183
-See you, Howard.
-See you, Tony.

329
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:17,978
AII right?

330
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,947
I definiteIy don't remember this happening.

331
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,727
<i>This is the real Howard Devoto.</i>

332
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:29,420
<i>He and Lindsay insisted we made clear</i>
<i>that this never happened.</i>

333
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,223
<i>But i agree with John Ford.</i>

334
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,235
<i>When you have to choose</i>
<i>between the truth and the legend...</i>

335
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,732
<i>...print the legend.</i>

336
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:39,063
I thought the name of the band was Warsaw.

337
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,134
You can't have a band caIIed Warsaw.
You can't put it on a poster, can you?

338
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,271
PeopIe wouId think it was a hoIiday advert.

339
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:48,043
Joy Division.
Do you know what that is, Mr. WiIson?

340
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,451
It's when the Nazis...

341
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:54,051
...picked out raciaIIy pure women
and had sex with them.

342
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,523
Joy Division, that's us, eh?

343
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,687
It's a very Nazi name.

344
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:02,253
-So?
-But it's quite cheery as weII.

345
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,992
You know, ''joy.''

346
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,593
Like a division of joy, or something.

347
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,864
Joy Division.

348
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:11,429
Let's aII say that together. One, two, three.

349
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:12,804
Joy.

350
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,542
Look at that fIat-bottomed vaIIey.

351
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:20,175
<i>it wasn't always crazy between me and Lindsay.</i>

352
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,974
<i>Most days, we were just another young couple...</i>

353
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:25,577
<i>...who wanted all the things</i>
<i>young couples want.</i>

354
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:28,881
<i>Nice house, nice car and a couple of kids.</i>

355
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,449
Enjoy the waIk, because it's just you and me.

356
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,094
WouIdn't you Iike a IittIe Tony
and a IittIe Lindsay waIking around?

357
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,724
It wouId be a nightmare.

358
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:41,567
I Iike to be free. AII right, in time, you know.

359
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:44,197
Okay. That's the Iast word
I'II say on the subject.

360
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:47,367
Two words, body cIock.

361
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:50,975
HeIIo, I'm here.

362
00:27:56,018 --> 00:28:00,045
The majors are the status quo,
and we're not, we're the anarchists.

363
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:03,319
It's gonna be Iike a co-op.
We're aII gonna share in the proceeds.

364
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:06,054
We pay for aII the costs,
and the rest of it is 50-50.

365
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:08,653
50 percent Factory,
50 percent goes to the artists.

366
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,756
AIan's gonna be head of business affairs.

367
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,631
That's Red Leb, that.
Have you smeIt it? SmeII that.

368
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,762
I'm giving you totaI creative freedom, right?

369
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,137
It's dead fucking simpIe.

370
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,768
Don't Iike us, fuck off. I don't Iike you, I fuck off.

371
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:25,371
I'II write a contract saying there's no contracts.
I'II write it in bIood.

372
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,972
-I'II do it.
-He's not gonna write it in his own bIood.

373
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,574
-Here you are.
-I'II do it.

374
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:32,119
You write it in your own bIood.

375
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:35,384
In the words of the great prophet,
''I dares do owt.''

376
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,584
It ain't IegaI, this.

377
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:41,519
-He's done it!
-There you go. ReaI bIood.

378
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:43,186
''I...

379
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,760
''...Tony....''

380
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,836
How can you read that?

381
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:51,065
I'm not sure if that'd stand up in court.

382
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,665
What more do you want?
He wrote it in his own bIood.

383
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:09,819
Martin?

384
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,654
What are you doing?

385
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:15,089
Recording...

386
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:16,924
...the siIence.

387
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,891
You're recording siIence?

388
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:25,139
Now I'm recording Tony fucking WiIson.

389
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:30,708
We want you to produce a band for us.

390
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:32,539
Who's us?

391
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,442
Factory Records.

392
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,746
Right, 50 quid an hour.

393
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:39,284
PIus, I wanna be a partner in the company.

394
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,552
See ya.

395
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,417
See ya.

396
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:56,461
<i>Stop that horrible fucking racket, please.</i>

397
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,028
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>

398
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:01,975
Nothing was wrong with the drumming as such,
it's just that...

399
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,977
<i>...people have been playing like that</i>
<i>for about 20,000 years, and quite frankly i'm....</i>

400
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:11,411
<i>it's boring the arse off me.</i>
<i>Let's just try something...</i>

401
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:13,853
<i>...a lot simpler, okay?</i>

402
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,082
Faster, but sIower.

403
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,058
-There's Iogic there somewhere.
-I know what he means.

404
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,235
Right, stop.

405
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:35,868
We've got a rattIe. We're gonna have to
dismantIe the whoIe fucking kit.

406
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,309
You are?

407
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:42,577
-How Iong's that gonna fucking take?
-I don't fucking know. As Iong as it takes.

408
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:47,153
Is this stiII costing us Pou50 an hour?

409
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,418
We're stiII working, aren't we?

410
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:55,660
What I'd Iike...

411
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,689
...is to rebuiId it on the roof.

412
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:02,067
On the roof?

413
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:04,871
On the actuaI roof of the studio?

414
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,175
BIoody heII.

415
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,480
Start pIaying.

416
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:20,078
How wiII I know when to stop?

417
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:23,886
Don't worry about stopping.
I'II send someone out when it's time to stop.

418
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:42,400
Sorry.

419
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:44,945
<i>Just remember, Tony Wilson's money.</i>

420
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:52,954
<i>Right, stop.</i>

421
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:56,423
<i>Stop!</i>

422
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,718
<i>Fucking retard.</i>

423
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:06,196
<i>-You wear it very well.</i>
-What?

424
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:09,829
<i>You wear it very well.</i>
<i>Now play like a fucking musician.</i>

425
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,003
Fucking prick.

426
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,143
-Listen to it in the car.
-It'II sound rubbish in the car.

427
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:21,671
I know, but we've got to see what it sounds Iike
on a transistor radio.

428
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,232
I sound Iike Bowie.

429
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:46,029
-That's good. You Iike Bowie.
-I hate fucking Bowie.

430
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:49,566
In <i>All The Young Dudes</i>,
he sings about how you shouId die at 25.

431
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:53,342
Do you know how oId he is?
He's 30, 29, something. He's a Iiar.

432
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:56,976
Doesn't matter. Many artists
produce their best work when they're oIder.

433
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:58,314
W.B. Yeats--

434
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:01,618
-I've never heard of him.
-Yeats is the greatest poet since Dante.

435
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,659
-If he'd have died when he was 25--
-I wouId have heard of him.

436
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,057
Hang on.

437
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,521
-Listen to it. This is great.
-This is fucking exceIIent.

438
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:12,533
-Are you Iistening to this? It's great.
-It's briIIiant.

439
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,831
It is. It's very good.

440
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,939
There's nothing out there that sounds Iike that.

441
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,736
That's the best thing about it.

442
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:22,733
-You Iike it?
-I do.

443
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,438
I Iove what he's done with the drums.

444
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:44,722
<i>Joy Division were a great band,</i>
<i>but they were Rob's band.</i>

445
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,665
<i>i wanted a band of my own.</i>

446
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:50,171
<i>A Certain Ratio had all the talent</i>
<i>and energy of Joy Division...</i>

447
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,103
<i>...but better clothes.</i>

448
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:55,707
-You Iook absoIuteIy fantastic.
-You reckon?

449
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:58,712
-It's great.
-We Iook Iike the bIoody HitIer Youth, man.

450
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,482
I think you Iook more Iike Scouts.

451
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,942
Have you seen our Iegs?
They're Iike fucking miIk bottIes.

452
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,078
I wouIdn't worry about it.
AIthough that reminds me.

453
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:10,818
I must get some chicken drumsticks
on the way home.

454
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,493
It's aII right, I've got it covered.

455
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,622
Instant tan. Tanfastic.

456
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:18,693
It's hedonism, it's shorts...

457
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,035
...it's funk...

458
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,300
-...it's tans, it's sexy.
-It's coId, man.

459
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,757
I Iike the haircuts, Barney.

460
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,198
They Iook good, don't they?

461
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,331
-Crap, though.
-Fucking shit.

462
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,898
What's the worst band name you ever heard?

463
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,429
Skinny Monkey.

464
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,667
The worst one I heard
was a mate of mine's band caIIed Barabbas.

465
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,301
Fucking Barabbas.

466
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,138
Who do you want? Barabbas!

467
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,236
<i>The National Front</i>
<i>took to the streets of Manchester today...</i>

468
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:41,002
<i>...in the biggest demonstration</i>
<i>of neo-Fascists since the '30s.</i>

469
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:58,492
<i>The Transport and General Workers Union</i>
<i>tighten their stranglehold...</i>

470
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,553
<i>...on the nation's petrol supplies,</i>
<i>bringing the country to a grinding halt.</i>

471
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:06,658
<i>Thousands of motorists queue all day,</i>
<i>amid rumors of fuel rationing...</i>

472
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,726
<i>...and a return to the three-day week.</i>

473
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:24,214
<i>More chaos in the public services as</i>
<i>mountains of rubbish fill London's West End...</i>

474
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:27,187
<i>...and nurses bring the hospitals</i>
<i>close to collapse.</i>

475
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,620
<i>Now gravediggers in Liverpool</i>
<i>refuse to bury the dead.</i>

476
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,180
Ian!

477
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,455
-What the fucking heII's the matter with him?
-Fuck knows. I don't know.

478
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,193
Fucking heII. Ian?

479
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,197
Fucking come on then!

480
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,664
-What are you doing?
-Fuck this.

481
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:20,572
-Rob? What the fuck are you doing?
-Come on then, you cunt!

482
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,408
Come on then.

483
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:26,542
Watch his head.

484
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,941
AII right, mate.

485
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,145
Fucking heII. His fucking mouth's bIeeding!

486
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,915
Has someone got a doctor?

487
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,150
I've just dropped two skinheads.

488
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:39,358
-What are you doing?
-He's got me fags.

489
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:40,894
You fucking twat!

490
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:44,830
-He's fucking bIeeding here.
-And I need a cigarette.

491
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,330
Where's Rob?

492
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:49,863
Can you get a fucking doctor?

493
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:51,633
He's fucking bIeeding here.

494
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,231
How do you answer the charge
that you're a fascist?

495
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,298
What?

496
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,369
Joy Division was named
after a group of women heId by the SS...

497
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:00,914
...for the purpose of breeding perfect Aryans.

498
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:03,576
Have you never heard of Situationism
or postmodernism?

499
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:04,744
We need a doctor in here.

500
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:07,117
Do you know about
the pIay of signs and signifiers?

501
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:10,555
The band's Joy Division.
We've aIso got one caIIed Durutti CoIumn.

502
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,957
I'm sure I don't need to point out the irony there.

503
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:15,326
-What the fuck's going on?
-We need a doctor.

504
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,524
-What's wrong with him?
-He's having a fit.

505
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,964
Fuck off!

506
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,601
-Fuck off, or I'II Iay one on you.
-He wiII. I've seen him do it.

507
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:26,670
-I'II get a doctor.
-CaIm down, Barney.

508
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,233
Don't fucking teII me to caIm down!
You fucking caIm down!

509
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:33,076
Fine. Fuck's sake.

510
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,146
Are you aII right there, Ian?

511
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,519
I'm fine, mate.

512
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:43,190
-Are you sure?
-I said I'm fine, Rob, yeah? Just shut up.

513
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,783
AII right, then. Fair enough.

514
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:49,722
Not even to teII you
that we're gonna tour America?

515
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,327
Fuck off.

516
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,959
I'm teIIing you, straight up,
we're gonna tour America.

517
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,161
Nice one.

518
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,601
Fuck, are you serious?

519
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:59,902
I've just toId you, straight up,
you're gonna tour America.

520
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:02,306
-Come on!
-Fucking heII, boys.

521
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:05,638
Fucking cheers. We're going to the US of A.

522
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:06,976
Cheers.

523
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:08,809
I can't fucking beIieve that.

524
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,373
I thought you'd Iike that.

525
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,545
Are we gonna be staying in top-cIass hoteIs?

526
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,817
ActuaIIy, you're in knocking shops,
and I'm in five-star hoteIs.

527
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,018
Suits me fine. I think we did better there, mate.

528
00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:21,688
I think I'd better rework that, actuaIIy.

529
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,132
Go Ieft.

530
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:38,140
Come by.

531
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:43,176
Peter. I don't want to interrupt your fIow.

532
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:44,513
Go Ieft.

533
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:46,746
-I am doing, obviousIy.
-No, you're aII right.

534
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,016
AII right. Why a duck?

535
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,684
He just started, you know, just by chance.

536
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,491
And he just started biting their ankIes.

537
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:59,025
But it doesn't harm them.
Not Iike if a dog did it, you know.

538
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,091
Right. Extraordinary.

539
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,966
-UnbeIievabIe.
-Aye.

540
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:06,530
-Have a go.
-Can I? What do I do? What do I say?

541
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:08,231
''Go Ieft.''

542
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,709
-And then do what?
-Just shout.

543
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,513
-Shout what?
-''Go Ieft.''

544
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,105
Oh, shout ''Go Ieft,'' right.

545
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:16,377
Go Ieft.

546
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,785
-See?
-That's remarkabIe.

547
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,085
I've not quite got the command of the....

548
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:24,282
WhistIe.

549
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,721
Can't quite do it that weII.

550
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:31,888
Go Ieft.

551
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:34,196
''Stick to what you're good at'' is the response...

552
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:36,760
...unIess you're a duck,
and then you can branch out.

553
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,380
Hey, Ian.

554
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:53,117
-How are you?
-AII right.

555
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:55,178
Is he in?

556
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:57,121
No, he's at <i>Granada</i>.

557
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,125
I've got a spIiff going. You gonna come in?

558
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,861
I can't. I've got to get back.

559
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:05,356
Cheers.

560
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,501
It's fantastic news about America.

561
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,260
It's good. I'm Iooking forward to it.

562
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:11,635
I'm reaIIy chuffed.

563
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,740
I'm bored.
You couId stay with me for a IittIe whiIe.

564
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,377
I've got to go. I'II catch him Iater.

565
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,574
AII right. I'II teII him you caIIed.

566
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:31,119
-Send you a postcard?
-Do. That wouId be great.

567
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,625
''Wish you were here.''

568
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,626
Debbie?

569
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:04,316
<i>So....</i>

570
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:06,920
<i>Your car is kaput.</i>

571
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,158
<i>And your girlfriend is gone.</i>

572
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:14,460
<i>When thine house they have sold....</i>

573
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:11,489
What I'm gonna do is, apart from asking
you any anecdotes about town criers...

574
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,891
-...I'II say, ''how is it reIevant today''?
-Sorry.

575
00:44:13,962 --> 00:44:15,725
And not just being for tourists, so--

576
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:17,230
-Can I just have a word?
-Yes?

577
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,425
-The office have just caIIed.
-Right.

578
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,464
Ian Curtis has died.

579
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:24,734
What do you mean?

580
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:26,398
He's hanged himseIf.

581
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,733
He was found at his home this morning.

582
00:44:29,644 --> 00:44:30,975
You're joking?

583
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,069
No.

584
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,605
-I'm sorry.
-What....

585
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:38,282
He's dead?

586
00:44:38,987 --> 00:44:40,045
Yeah.

587
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:45,285
What a stupid bIoody bugger.

588
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:52,589
Sorry about this, mate.

589
00:44:56,504 --> 00:44:57,937
It's a friend of mine.

590
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:03,277
Ian Curtis...

591
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:07,781
...Iead singer of Joy Division...

592
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:11,012
...has died today.

593
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:19,717
It's reaIIy beautifuI.

594
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:25,857
<i>ian Curtis...</i>

595
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,764
<i>...writer of...</i>

00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:31,669

00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:32,831
<i>...has died today.</i>

598
00:45:32,907 --> 00:45:35,375
I Iike it. I do.

599
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:43,545
<i>if you listen to ian's music</i>
<i>and you know that he killed himself...</i>

600
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:47,452
...then you probabIy imagine
some very dark, depressive figure.

601
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:50,346
A prophet of urban decay and aIienation.

602
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:53,554
But I have some wonderfuI memories of him.

603
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:57,490
Such as the very Iast Factory night
at the RusseII CIub.

604
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,915
Pogo Iike a bastard!

605
00:47:02,497 --> 00:47:03,930
<i>We gotta go.</i>

606
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:07,598
<i>Fuck off.</i>

607
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:25,576
Mr. WiIson?

608
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:26,984
Tony, hi.

609
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:29,113
I know this isn't a very good time...

610
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,216
...but I've made a tape
of me singing Joy Division songs.

611
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:33,885
You probabIy need a new singer now--

612
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:36,361
-Don't hang about.
-PIay it to the rest of the band--

613
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,955
-Can you give this to him?
-I've practiced the dance.

614
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:41,729
-They won't Iet us in.
-I'II make sure he gets that.

615
00:47:41,802 --> 00:47:43,827
-He meant a Iot to us.
-AII right, mate.

616
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:45,429
Thank you for coming.

617
00:47:45,506 --> 00:47:48,566
It's not reaIIy the time for autographs,
but thanks for coming.

618
00:47:48,643 --> 00:47:50,508
MichaeI, what are you doing here?

619
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,809
I'm not here as a journaIist.
I'm mourning, you know. I'm gutted.

620
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:56,543
-You are gonna write about it?
-I don't think I can.

621
00:47:56,617 --> 00:47:59,609
-You must. You have to. Come in.
-Is that aII right?

622
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:01,314
It's good that you're here.

623
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,458
How are you doing?

624
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,460
AII right, mate.

625
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:16,834
-I just can't beIieve it.
-AII right, mate.

626
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,465
It's good to see you.

627
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,576
I want you to write the book.

628
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:26,545
You're the right person in the right pIace.
You shouId do it.

629
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:29,845
-It's just so soon, it's sad.
-It's historic.

630
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:32,408
Come on, this is where your book shouId start.

631
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:38,955
-I didn't reaIize you were here, mate.
-Hi, Tony. How are you doing?

632
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:43,159
This is Ian's gran.

633
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:47,191
-Tony WiIson.
-Thanks for aII you did.

634
00:48:47,902 --> 00:48:51,030
I've seen you on the teIIy.
You aIways Iook so smart.

635
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:53,266
Let's go and get a cuppa tea, shaII we?

636
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:04,381
That is the musicaI equivaIent of Che Guevara.

637
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:12,419
I'm gonna go.

638
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,192
I just don't feeI, you know....

639
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,421
I'II speak to you.

640
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:21,424
Take it aII in.

641
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:41,484
Bye, son.

642
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,587
Don't beat about the bush.

643
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:50,283
I'II ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

644
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:52,758
AII right? Give me the dignity of that.

645
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,821
Are you Ieaving me?

646
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:56,689
Yes.

647
00:50:58,332 --> 00:51:00,095
Bad energy around here now.

648
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:03,432
What does that mean, ''bad energy''?
What the fuck does that....

649
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:05,930
Energy? You don't know what energy is.

650
00:51:06,374 --> 00:51:09,468
-That is Iate 20th century hokum...
-Don't say another word.

651
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:12,011
...masquerading as spirituaIity.

652
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,180
Don't touch me.

653
00:51:18,853 --> 00:51:22,414
-That is the Iast time you wiII ever touch me.
-AII right.

654
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:27,451
AII right,
that is the Iast time you'II ever touch me.

655
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:33,156
I'm asking you reaIIy niceIy...

656
00:51:34,502 --> 00:51:35,764
...pIease...

657
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:38,968
...don't Ieave me.

658
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:47,313
Just fuck off, go, don't....

659
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:52,912
Don't.

660
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,487
Don't Ieave me.

661
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:12,698
Right. Okay.

662
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:14,772
Thank you.

663
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:17,099
Fuck off.

664
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:25,115
<i>This is a low point for me, obviously.</i>

665
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:26,650
<i>But...</i>

666
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:29,986
...I think it was Scott FitzgeraId who said:

667
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:33,649
''American Iives don't have second acts.''

668
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,058
This is Manchester.
We do things differentIy here.

669
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:42,460
This is the second act.

670
00:52:56,183 --> 00:52:58,583
''Two IittIe dicky birds sitting on a waII...

671
00:52:58,686 --> 00:53:02,588
''...one caIIed Peter and one caIIed PauI.''
Just Iike you, Looby Lou.

672
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,448
Turkey-Iurkey.

673
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:07,455
Goosey-Ioosey. Henny-penny.
Do you know what I mean?

674
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:09,220
No.

675
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,670
The history of popuIar music
is Iike a doubIe heIix.

676
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:27,543
That's two waves that intertwine.

677
00:53:27,748 --> 00:53:31,479
When one wave goes Iike this,
the other one goes Iike that.

678
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:32,917
You've got two...

679
00:53:33,988 --> 00:53:35,512
...waves doing that.

680
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,383
One Iike that, and one Iike that.

681
00:53:38,526 --> 00:53:42,792
When one musicaI movement is in the
descendant, another one is in the ascendant.

682
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:45,991
Right now, we're in a kind of a crisscross,
a kind of hiatus.

683
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:49,365
But the two guys that are gonna be
on the crest of the next wave...

684
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:51,495
...are PauI and Shaun Ryder.

685
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,306
This is a true incident...

686
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:56,434
...a bit Iike the hang-gIiding,
which works on two IeveIs.

687
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,138
This takes pIace in 1980, when Shaun and PauI...

688
00:53:59,213 --> 00:54:03,115
...put rat poison into some bread
and fed it to 3,000 pigeons.

689
00:54:05,152 --> 00:54:08,883
Rick RastardIy, wing ding,
forever and ever, amen.

690
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:12,817
There you go. Catch it! It's down!

691
00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:21,797
ObviousIy, it's a reconstruction.

692
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:25,168
No pigeons were harmed
in the making of this fiIm.

693
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:28,440
AIthough there are those that say they're pests.

694
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:30,768
Rats with wings.

695
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:41,879
Take that!

696
00:54:57,271 --> 00:55:00,638
Fac 51, a.k.a. the Hacienda.

697
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:03,606
BuiIdings create synergy.

698
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:06,044
They're a focus for creativity.

699
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:10,174
When the Victorians buiIt the raiIways,
they didn't just put up Portakabins...

700
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:13,019
-...they went to town.
-Jesus Christ.

701
00:55:14,154 --> 00:55:17,988
Just Iisten to the reverberation.
It's IoveIy, isn't it? The sound of my voice.

702
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:21,956
BuiIdings change the way peopIe think.

703
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:23,826
That happened in Renaissance FIorence.

704
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:26,024
But this isn't Renaissance FIorence.

705
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,933
This is Dark Ages Manchester.

706
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,433
It's Iike a fucking abattoir.

707
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,701
Tickets for tonight.

708
00:55:37,378 --> 00:55:38,367
Right.

709
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,843
What fucking good are they now?

710
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:44,146
I'm sorry they're a bit Iate, but...

711
00:55:44,652 --> 00:55:46,916
...thought we might use them as a souvenir.

712
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:48,420
That's aII right.

713
00:55:49,356 --> 00:55:51,415
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

714
00:55:51,492 --> 00:55:53,551
This is gonna be the number-one invitation.

715
00:55:53,627 --> 00:55:56,255
They didn't hand out tickets
for the Sermon on the Mount.

716
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,798
PeopIe just turned up.
They knew it was a good gig.

717
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:02,830
How much has come out, in totaI,
from our music budget?

718
00:56:03,037 --> 00:56:04,299
Pou700,000.

719
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:11,140
Goodbye.
We obviousIy have nothing in common.

720
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:15,248
I'm a genius, you're fucking wankers.
You'II never see me again.

721
00:56:15,315 --> 00:56:17,306
You don't deserve to see me again.

722
00:56:25,225 --> 00:56:28,092
-It's nice, though, innit?
-Fantastic, mate.

723
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:37,330
<i>May 21, 1982.</i>

724
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:39,133
<i>The night the Hacienda opened.</i>

725
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:41,240
<i>Everyone wanted to play.</i>

726
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:43,674
<i>Bowie, Queen, The Stones.</i>

727
00:56:43,744 --> 00:56:47,145
<i>i chose A Certain Ratio,</i>
<i>because they were my band.</i>

728
00:56:47,214 --> 00:56:49,273
<i>And that was the point of the Hacienda.</i>

729
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:52,546
<i>it was a place for people we knew,</i>
<i>people we could trust.</i>

730
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,447
I can't beIieve this.
They have totaIIy betrayed us here.

731
00:56:56,757 --> 00:56:58,918
What a fucking joke.

732
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:01,761
I don't know, Rob.

733
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:03,896
You know, it might work.

734
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:05,898
Has there been a Wythenshawe Jazz Band?

735
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:07,593
There hasn't, thank fucking God.

736
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:11,434
Let me teII you, right,
jazz is the Iast refuge of the untaIented.

737
00:57:11,505 --> 00:57:15,805
Jazz musicians enjoy themseIves
far more than anyone Iistening to them.

738
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:17,673
It's Iike theatre.

739
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:20,006
It's what you do when you can't get a gig.

740
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:22,875
It's one down from <i>Celebrity Squares</i>.

741
00:57:28,388 --> 00:57:30,652
ExceIIent, weII done. Very good.

742
00:57:30,724 --> 00:57:32,715
Where is everyone?

743
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,689
We had 100 on the guest Iist.

744
00:57:34,762 --> 00:57:37,925
You were at the Sex PistoIs' gig.
How many peopIe were there?

745
00:57:37,998 --> 00:57:40,398
-It was about 40.
-Right, and it was history.

746
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:43,027
But there's onIy 30 here tonight.

747
00:57:44,571 --> 00:57:45,560
ExactIy.

748
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:48,005
The smaIIer the attendance,
the bigger the history.

749
00:57:48,075 --> 00:57:50,168
There were 12 peopIe at the Last Supper.

750
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:52,535
HaIf a dozen at Kitty Hawk.

751
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:55,241
Archimedes was on his own in the bath.

752
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:05,949
<i>Pick on someone your own size. Or maybe not.</i>

753
00:58:06,026 --> 00:58:07,721
We're here at Chester Zoo...

754
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:10,821
...to see a bath-time version
of David and GoIiath.

755
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:22,733
It's a bit of a mammoth task for...

756
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:24,876
...a young chap Iike yourseIf.

757
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,240
-This isn't your normaI job, is it?
-No, I'm an entertainer.

758
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:32,444
Right, okay.

759
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:36,512
And I saw there's a IittIe baby over....
Watch yourseIf there.

760
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:39,751
There's a baby eIephant....
HeIIo, how do you do?

761
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:44,557
There's peopIe Iike that I work with at <i>Granada</i>.

762
00:58:44,631 --> 00:58:47,566
Except that he's a IittIe bit more attractive.

763
00:58:47,634 --> 00:58:49,829
This morning, I was doing a feature...

764
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:52,565
...on an eIephant being washed by a midget.

765
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:53,970
It was a dwarf.

766
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,202
-That doesn't matter.
-It matters to him.

767
00:58:56,276 --> 00:58:58,836
Look, I'm a serious journaIist. I've got a degree.

768
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:01,506
Get me a proper gig, or Iet's forget we ever met.

769
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:02,742
Tony, Iisten.

770
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:06,343
''Shy shy, hush hush, eye to eye.''
What do you reckon?

771
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,184
Very good. I'II make you a big star.
Sign you up tomorrow.

772
00:59:09,256 --> 00:59:11,850
-Catch you Iater.
-Right. Don't caII me.

773
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:15,019
You know your probIem?
You take yourseIf too seriousIy.

774
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:18,790
I do. I take myseIf very fucking seriousIy.

775
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:23,096
What about a feature
on the Northwest's taIIest man?

776
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,637
Fuck off.

777
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:45,447
<i>No band ever survives</i>
<i>the death of their lead singer.</i>

778
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:48,723
<i>So, when Joy Division became New Order...</i>

779
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:51,127
<i>...no one expected them to succeed.</i>

780
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:54,900
As you've no visuaI imagination,
I've done you a mock-up.

781
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,429
-It's Iike a fIoppy disk.
-FIoppy disk.

782
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:00,063
It's fucking briIIiant.

783
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,142
-It's pure, it's workmanIike, it's poetic.
-It's expensive.

784
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,872
Four-coIor printing. Cut out and gatefoId.

785
01:00:05,946 --> 01:00:07,641
It's fucking beautifuI.

786
01:00:07,714 --> 01:00:10,410
I never count the cost of beauty,
you shouId know that.

787
01:00:13,353 --> 01:00:15,378
Can I taIk to you about these sIeeves?

788
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,513
Sure.

789
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:19,123
Have you costed it? Because I have.

790
01:00:19,326 --> 01:00:23,422
We Iose five pence on every singIe one
of these records that we seII.

791
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:26,125
We're gonna seII fuck-aII, so it doesn't matter.

792
01:00:38,779 --> 01:00:42,340
BIue Monday <i>became</i>
<i>the biggest selling 12-inch single ever...</i>

793
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,782
<i>...which made loads of money for New Order.</i>

794
01:00:46,086 --> 01:00:47,815
<i>Not that they saw any of it.</i>

795
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:50,353
<i>Because every penny they earned...</i>

796
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:53,188
<i>...was swallowed up</i>
<i>by the debts of the Hacienda.</i>

797
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:06,102
<i>Thank you.</i>

798
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:07,532
Bravo.

801
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:19,112
I'II have a coke, pIease. Thank you.

802
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:22,388
A coke and a gin and tonic, pIease.

803
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:25,018
-How was that?
-It was great.

804
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:26,582
It was wonderfuI.

805
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:28,928
Great, it was just...

806
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:30,991
...I Iove it.

807
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:34,100
Tuesday night.

808
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:38,133
We need to have a rethink of our strategy.

809
01:01:38,205 --> 01:01:42,801
You know, whatever we achieve,
the important thing to remember is that...

810
01:01:43,643 --> 01:01:46,271
...you make wonderfuI music.

811
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:48,071
Great.

812
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:57,281
Can you spare 20 pence, mate,
pIease, for a cuppa tea?

813
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,551
-There you go, keep that.
-Ta, mate.

of an unidentified fIying object...

825
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:44,329
...over the LittIe HaIton district of Manchester.

826

ApparentIy the aIiens fIew Iow over the district...

827
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,941
...and then disappeared,
which is kind of understandabIe.

828
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,810
If you're Iistening, spacemen,
next time you might wanna try MarpIe instead.

829
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,405

Get the gear in the back first.

840
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:22,359
It's dance music, and it's rock music.
It's got a kind of....

841
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:24,729
It's got that indie guitar sound...

842

...and it's got the kind of whacka-whacka,
wah-wah thing.

It's souIfuI and it's rocky.

<i>This is Bez.</i>

Four thousand years ago,
the Egyptians buiIt the very first canaI.

877
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,190
The first canaI in Britain
was buiIt by the Romans.

878
01:06:30,263 --> 01:06:31,821
The Fossdyke in LincoIn.

879
01:06:37,504 --> 01:06:40,064
This is the RochdaIe CanaI, buiIt in 1804...

880
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,303
...when Manchester
was the worId's greatest industriaI city.

881
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:53,978
Their negIect mirrors the decIine...

882
01:06:54,054 --> 01:06:56,989
...of post-war IndustriaI Britain.

883
01:07:09,536 --> 01:07:11,800
<i>Suddenly, everything came together.</i>

884
01:07:12,005 --> 01:07:15,964
<i>The music, the dancing,</i>
<i>the drugs, the venue, the city.</i>

885
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:20,975
<i>i was proved right.</i>
<i>Manchester was like Renaissance Florence.</i>

886
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:24,608
<i>Mike Pickering was right.</i>
<i>You don't need bands in a club.</i>

887
01:07:24,684 --> 01:07:28,814
<i>Shaun Ryder was right.</i>
<i>New Order were right. We all came together.</i>

888
01:07:29,389 --> 01:07:33,416
<i>Everyone came to the Hacienda.</i>
<i>it was our cathedral.</i>

889
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,040
<i>Manchester, birthplace to the railways...</i>

890
01:07:50,243 --> 01:07:51,904
<i>...the computer...</i>

891
01:07:52,045 --> 01:07:53,842
<i>...the bouncing bomb.</i>

892
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:58,916
And tonight, something equaIIy
as epoch-making is taking pIace.

893
01:07:59,686 --> 01:08:00,618
See?

894
01:08:05,825 --> 01:08:08,316
They're appIauding the DJ.

895
01:08:08,728 --> 01:08:12,164
Not the music, not the musician,
not the creator...

896
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:14,629
...but the medium.

897
01:08:15,502 --> 01:08:16,969
This is it...

898
01:08:17,036 --> 01:08:19,231
...the birth of rave cuIture.

899
01:08:19,606 --> 01:08:21,870
The beatification of the beat.

900
01:08:22,075 --> 01:08:26,569
The dance age. This is the moment
when even the White man starts dancing.

901
01:08:27,013 --> 01:08:28,878
WeIcome to Manchester.

902
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:51,632
I have with me
a very speciaI new friend of mine...

903
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:53,296
...Mr. Peter Duff...

904
01:08:53,373 --> 01:08:57,935
...who worked on the canaIs,
not just in this century, but in the Iast one.

905
01:08:58,178 --> 01:08:59,338
Peter.

906
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,814
The canaIs, how many years ago....

907
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:06,579
What year was it
that you started working on the canaIs?

908
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:08,078
1900.

909
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:10,088
1900. Right.

910
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:13,390
On the cusp of a new age.

911
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,593
What do you remember
about the canaIs in those days?

912
01:09:17,897 --> 01:09:19,330
Very IittIe.

913
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,897
-Very IittIe.
-PeacefuI.

914
01:09:23,603 --> 01:09:25,127
-PeacefuI?
-Yes.

915
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:28,397
I don't think we're gonna be abIe
to use much of that.

916
01:09:28,475 --> 01:09:32,002
Do you want....
I mean, the chap's bareIy standing.

917
01:09:39,085 --> 01:09:40,575
-Hi, Tony.
-Hi.

918
01:09:56,369 --> 01:09:58,462
-Tony, how's it going?
-Great. WonderfuI.

919
01:09:58,538 --> 01:09:59,664
Thought we'd get the kids--

920
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:02,333
-This'II be in the Mondays' video?
-This is gonna be it.

921
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:05,969
-But that's Brian and MichaeI.
-I know, but the singIe's not finished.

922
01:10:06,045 --> 01:10:08,104
It was supposed to be done two weeks ago.

923
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:11,150
You know what he's Iike. He's aIways a bit sIow.

924
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:14,152
-Why? Who's producing this?
-Martin Hannett.

925
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,083
For fuck's sake.

926
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:18,383
Did you not know?

927
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:20,686
No, I didn't know.

928
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:25,523
-Anyway, must crack on.
-These are great. The kids are great.

929
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:26,758
HeIIo.

930
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,539
<i>The last time i'd seen Martin</i>
<i>was five years earlier.</i>

931
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:42,809
<i>The Hacienda was costing New Order</i>
<i>$10,000 a month...</i>

932
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:44,713
<i>...and none of us had a clue what to do.</i>

933
01:10:44,784 --> 01:10:46,445
You know broccoIi?

934
01:10:46,853 --> 01:10:48,718
BroccoIi, the vegetabIe?

935
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:49,880
Yeah.

936
01:10:56,262 --> 01:11:00,926
That was invented by Cubby BroccoIi,
the producer of the James Bond fiIms.

937
01:11:01,234 --> 01:11:03,532
LittIe-known fact. It's true.

938
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:17,108
It's a crossbred vegetabIe.
It's haIf cauIifIower, haIf--

939
01:11:17,183 --> 01:11:20,380
-What?
-HaIf something. A green.

940
01:11:21,454 --> 01:11:24,480
It's haIf a green thing that I don't know.

941
01:11:24,557 --> 01:11:26,115
HaIf a cauIifIower.

942
01:11:26,192 --> 01:11:28,660
And the BroccoIi.... Cubby BroccoIi's famiIy....

943
01:11:28,728 --> 01:11:32,528
Was inventing vegetabIes
before they started making movies?

944
01:11:32,932 --> 01:11:36,868
-That's what bankroIIed the Bond fiIms.
-I don't beIieve you.

945
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:38,927
-That is a fact.
-I don't beIieve you.

946
01:11:39,072 --> 01:11:41,540
It's fact. Look it up in EncycIopedia Britannica.

947
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:45,066
-Where am I gonna Iook that up?
-It's absoIute fact, that.

948
01:11:52,552 --> 01:11:53,917
Thanks, Martin.

Hi, guys.

951
01:11:59,993 --> 01:12:02,086
Where is the Mad Professor?

952
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:04,663
Fucking crying in there.

953
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:07,996
We need to get him a teat.
We can't get fuck-aII done.

956
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:15,366

He's back in his cIoset.

959
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:24,174
HeIIo, Hannett, you wanker.

960

<i>Hello, Wilson, wanker.</i>

961
01:12:30,523 --> 01:12:34,926
I'm trying to get these shower of cunts
that masquerade as a band...

962
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:39,260
...to pIay some fucking music,
which seems to be the greatest...

963
01:12:39,332 --> 01:12:42,597
...and most difficuIt thing
I've ever had to do in my fucking Iife.

964
01:12:42,669 --> 01:12:44,603
-Take it down, Mart.
-Sorry, come on.

965
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:47,469
He's caImed down a Iot

966
01:12:48,675 --> 01:12:50,370
-Martin--
-Fuck off!

967
01:12:52,545 --> 01:12:56,447
You can't threaten me any more.
You're a big man, but you're out of shape.

968
01:12:56,949 --> 01:12:59,144
AIthough you couId sit on me.

969
01:12:59,886 --> 01:13:02,013
I've got something for you.

970
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,274
There you go, mate.

971
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:59,810
Can you turn that porn off?
We've got a Iady on the bus.

972
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:02,609
Leave it on. I think I'm in this one.

973
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,212
Go on, Roe.

974
01:14:18,865 --> 01:14:20,958
PuII those curtains to.

975
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,239
What's up with you?
What are you Iooking at me Iike that for?

976
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,334
I'm not Iooking at you.

977
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:34,675
-You are.
-I was Iooking at Bez.

978
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:37,773
You are Iooking at me.
What's up with you? Are you jeaIous?

979
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:41,718
JeaIous of what? I'm not jeaIous.
If I wanted you, I couId have you right now.

980
01:14:41,788 --> 01:14:43,346
I'm not jeaIous of nobody.

981
01:14:47,226 --> 01:14:51,390
Tony. Sir Anthony, sir.
Can I interest you in some CharIeston, sir?

982
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:55,192
No, I think cocaine's a suits' drug.
It's a destroyer of taIent.

983
01:14:55,301 --> 01:14:57,963
We haven't got any fucking taIent.
Roe, chop him one out.

984
01:14:58,037 --> 01:15:00,198
That's why it's fine for you to use it.

985
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:03,708
-You're a very giving person, sir.
-Go on, Tone.

986
01:15:03,776 --> 01:15:04,800
One of us!

987
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:19,216
Never judge a book by its cover,
that's what I say.

988
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:21,487
And you've got a very nice cover, by the way.

989
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:23,654
-A first edition. Very coIIectibIe.
-Thank you.

990
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,663
-Hi, Tony.
-HeIIo, Iove.

991
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:29,566
<i>This is Yvette.</i>
<i>She's actually Miss United Kingdom.</i>

992
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:32,132
<i>But that's not what attracted me to her.</i>

993
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:36,801
That's where they do <i>Stars in Their Eyes</i>,
interiors of <i>Coronation Street</i>.

994
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:38,070
HeIIo, Iove. You aII right?

-It's nice to see you again.
-And you, as ever.

01:15:40,947 --> 01:15:43,347
-And what do you do?
-How do you mean?

997
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,782
You know, your job. Here.

I'm Tony WiIson.

999
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:52,453

-Pop this. Have this.

1000
01:15:52,525 --> 01:15:54,356
-Put that on.
-Thank you.

1001
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:56,224
You can keep it. It's cashmere.

1002

-Of course.

1003

-Thank you.
-Least I can do for Miss UK.

1004
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:02,097
I haven't got a tiara, so that'II have to do.

1005
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:05,968
I mean, <i>Granada</i> reaIIy is just sort of my hobby.
My proper job....

1006
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:08,063
-Do you know the Happy Mondays?
-I Iove them.

1007
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,199
-I Iook after them. Factory Records.
-ReaIIy?

-That's my IabeI. New Order?
-Yeah.

1009
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:15,246
Heard of them? There you go.

1010
01:16:15,314 --> 01:16:18,010
-Do you know the Hacienda?
-It's fantastic.

1011
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:20,211
-I own that nightcIub. Part owner.
-ReaIIy?

1012
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:22,481
If you ever want reduced admission, see me.

1013
01:16:22,555 --> 01:16:26,150
Better stiII, you get in free if you escort me.
I'm fIirting, by the way.

1014
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:28,625
-You are.
-It's that obvious?

1015
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:32,723
Don't judge. Piety's a very unattractive quaIity.

1016
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:35,733
FIirting is a very naturaI process,

1017
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:39,066

Shaun, where the fuck are you, son?

1032

1039
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:54,229
<i>So i knew, even then, that choosing Nathan...</i>

1040
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:57,764
<i>...as the new manager of the Mondays</i>
<i>was not necessarily a good idea.</i>

-I'm gonna Iook after them.

1057
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:21,589
<i>And if you were a Manc,</i>
<i>everyone wanted a part of you.</i>

1058
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,957
-Tone.
-Yes?

1059
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:26,395
-Coming back for a wabosh, mate? Come on.
-I've eaten, thanks.

1060
01:20:27,266 --> 01:20:29,598
-You're Iooking very beautifuI.
-He owns the Hacienda.

1061
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:32,796
-I'm the big guy.
-He's the big one. He's the big boss.

1062
01:20:33,139 --> 01:20:35,004
MetaphoricaIIy speaking.

1063
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:37,903
<i>it was like being on a fantastic fairground ride...</i>

1064
01:20:37,977 --> 01:20:40,912
<i>...centrifugal forces</i>
<i>throwing us wider and wider.</i>

1065
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,040
<i>And there's this brilliant machine at the center...</i>

1066
01:20:44,116 --> 01:20:46,050
<i>...that's gonna bring us back to earth.</i>

1067
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:49,178
<i>That was Manchester. That was the Hacienda</i>.

1068
01:20:49,755 --> 01:20:51,484
<i>Now imagine the machine breaks.</i>

1069
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:54,151
<i>For a while it's better,</i>
<i>because you're really flying...</i>

1070
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:58,128
<i>...but then you're fucked,</i>
<i>because nobody beats gravity.</i>

1071
01:21:02,301 --> 01:21:03,563
I'm back.

1072
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:07,735
What are you doing here? I thought
you were in gIamorous fucking London.

1073
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:11,235
I went to interview Sir Keith Joseph.

1074
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:15,207
It's very important.
He Iikes to be caIIed Sir Keith.

1075
01:21:15,281 --> 01:21:17,545
His knighthood's very important to him.

1076
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:22,216
They caII him the Mad Monk.
That's important at the end of the story.

1077
01:21:22,555 --> 01:21:25,956
<i>i was supposed to get the train, right?</i>
<i>But i didn't, i drove.</i>

1078
01:21:26,025 --> 01:21:28,892
<i>i'm driving along, really well...</i>

1079
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:32,592
<i>...and i end up on this fucking Pennine.</i>

1080
01:21:33,966 --> 01:21:36,526
There you go. A mobiIe phone.
Do you know how it works?

1081
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:38,433
Yeah. I've used them before.

1082
01:21:38,637 --> 01:21:41,231
<i>And i make a phone call</i>
<i>on this mobile phone thing.</i>

1083
01:21:42,675 --> 01:21:45,337
<i>it's like listening to a fucking headache.</i>

1084
01:21:50,849 --> 01:21:53,409
And then I was waIking aIong a raiIway Iine...

1085
01:21:53,786 --> 01:21:56,254
<i>...and a train goes roaring past.</i>

1086
01:21:58,357 --> 01:22:00,552
<i>And i climbed onto the train.</i>

1087
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,924
You can't come in here, son.

1088
01:22:05,864 --> 01:22:08,059
I'm sorry, do you know who I am?

1089
01:22:08,534 --> 01:22:11,025
Ernie, we've got one here
doesn't know who he is.

1090
01:23:59,712 --> 01:24:01,509
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

1091
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,276
<i>When we built the Hacienda, it was too soon.</i>

1092
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:07,148
<i>When we built the Factory office, it was too late.</i>

1093
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:10,950
<i>it did, however, have a zinc roof,</i>
<i>which was very cool.</i>

1094
01:24:11,056 --> 01:24:14,116
<i>Even though you could only see it</i>
<i>if you were in a helicopter.</i>

1095
01:24:14,793 --> 01:24:16,693
At Iast, Factory has...

1096
01:24:17,663 --> 01:24:19,392
...a proper office.

1097
01:24:24,036 --> 01:24:26,698
It's made of MDF.

1098
01:24:27,339 --> 01:24:29,364
What are aII these about?

1099
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:31,467
How much was it?

1100
01:24:31,844 --> 01:24:36,008
It's not the materiaI, Hooky.
You're paying for design.

1101
01:24:36,081 --> 01:24:39,244
I didn't ask about the materiaI.
I asked how much it was.

1102
01:24:39,318 --> 01:24:42,685
-It was Pou30,000. But--
-Did you pick the shape?

1103
01:24:43,122 --> 01:24:46,319
-It was what?
-No, the shape is something that....

1104
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:50,352
-Pou30,000?
-The point is, if you go to any London--

1105
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:51,657
For a fucking tabIe?

1106
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:54,460
If you go to any London record company....

1107
01:24:56,568 --> 01:24:59,059
Are you out of your mind, you dozy prick?

1108
01:24:59,138 --> 01:25:02,073
ShaII we Iet go of him,
and shaII we not fucking do that?

1109
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:03,574
-You aII right?
-Yeah, fine.

1110
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:05,337
-No, it's aII right.
-Are you okay?

1111
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:07,470
-I'm absoIuteIy fine.
-Okay.

1112
01:25:07,546 --> 01:25:11,004
-Rob, sit down.
-I'm aII right, honestIy.

1113
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:16,684
Pou30,000 for a fucking tabIe, you cunt!

1114
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:20,884
WiII you stop? For God's sake.

1115
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:26,954
<i>There was only one problem with the Hacienda.</i>
<i>it never made any money.</i>

1116
01:25:27,032 --> 01:25:29,500
<i>There were huge crowds</i>
<i>and a great atmosphere.</i>

1117
01:25:29,568 --> 01:25:32,662
<i>But it was all fueled by ecstasy, not alcohol.</i>

1118
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:37,298
<i>And we didn't sell E at the bar.</i>
<i>Although we did talk about it.</i>

1119
01:25:37,743 --> 01:25:42,407
<i>We were spending money on the building,</i>
<i>the staff, the DJs, the sound system...</i>

1120
01:25:42,681 --> 01:25:45,172
<i>...but most of the money</i>
<i>went to the drug dealers.</i>

1121
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,083
<i>And guess what?</i>
<i>They didn't give the money to us.</i>

1122
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:52,214
<i>They spent it on clothes</i>
<i>or cars or restaurants or houses...</i>

1123
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:54,723
<i>...or girls or guns.</i>

1124
01:25:55,727 --> 01:25:57,319
<i>Especially guns.</i>

1125
01:26:11,176 --> 01:26:12,438
AII right, man?

1126
01:26:18,016 --> 01:26:22,248
<i>Drug dealers are like any other businessmen.</i>
<i>They like to increase their market share.</i>

1127
01:26:22,321 --> 01:26:26,121
You IittIe fucking pricks,
teII your mum I give you this.

1128
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:30,051
<i>Only, suppliers don't tend</i>
<i>to undercut each other on prices...</i>

1129
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:32,096
<i>...just try to get rid of the competition.</i>

1130
01:26:43,542 --> 01:26:46,272
<i>Soon, the violence spread to the Hacienda.</i>

1131
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:48,445
-Hi, big feIIa.
-What can I do for you?

1132
01:26:48,514 --> 01:26:51,847
-Everybody pays, even gang members.
-Give him a sIap, PeI.

1133
01:26:52,951 --> 01:26:54,543
He shot him!

1134
01:26:55,854 --> 01:26:58,789
<i>This is bad in itself,</i>
<i>but it's also bad for business.</i>

1135
01:26:58,857 --> 01:27:02,088
<i>And when someone's carrying a gun,</i>
<i>it's hard to turn them away.</i>

1136
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,563
<i>Pretty soon there's shootings inside the club</i>
<i>as well as on the door.</i>

1137
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:17,367
<i>if you've got a lot of drugs and guns</i>
<i>in your club...</i>

1138
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:19,171
<i>...you're gonna get shut down.</i>

1139
01:27:19,244 --> 01:27:21,769
<i>So, you have to try and control it.</i>

1140
01:27:22,814 --> 01:27:25,305
<i>i took advice from Plutarch's</i> Life of Caesar...

1141
01:27:25,384 --> 01:27:29,150
<i>...where it says, ''Keep your friends close,</i>
<i>but your enemies closer.''</i>

1142
01:27:29,221 --> 01:27:32,679
<i>The problem is often the solution</i>
<i>in a different set of clothes.</i>

1143
01:27:34,059 --> 01:27:35,549
Come on in.

1144
01:27:37,095 --> 01:27:40,394
<i>in this case, we gave the drug dealers</i>
<i>the doorman's uniform.</i>

1145
01:27:40,465 --> 01:27:43,696
<i>Now we didn't control the door or the drugs.</i>

1146
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:46,037
You as weII, Iove, come on.

1147
01:27:46,104 --> 01:27:49,665
I'm sorry, it's not your scene tonight, mate.
Come on.

1148
01:27:49,741 --> 01:27:51,299
I pay your fucking wages, mate.

1149
01:27:51,376 --> 01:27:54,311
-You're on a wind-up, aren't you?
-Just fucking do one.

1150
01:27:54,379 --> 01:27:55,971

1157
01:28:30,048 --> 01:28:31,413
Nice views.

1158
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,485
BeautifuI.

TroIIs.

1160
01:28:41,093 --> 01:28:43,527
I used to have TroIIs when I was IittIe.

Do you stiII caII them TroIIs?

1162

01:28:47,132 --> 01:28:49,726
-I've got you a mobiIe phone.
-Thanks.

1164
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:53,268
Mummy's got a phone,

1165
01:28:53,338 --> 01:28:56,432
So, it's Iike tin cans with string.

1166
01:28:57,309 --> 01:29:00,574
-Remember when we made tin cans with string?
-Yeah.

1167
01:29:03,181 --> 01:29:05,206
TaIked down the end of it?

1168
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:07,944
I've got to go to Martin Hannett's...

...funeraI.

1170
01:29:09,788 --> 01:29:11,779
-Who?
-Martin Hannett.

1171
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,720
Had a heart attack.

1172
01:29:16,461 --> 01:29:17,655
Okay...

1173
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:22,990
...I shouId have found time to teII you earIier,
I did have chiIdren with my second wife, HiIary.

1174
01:29:23,201 --> 01:29:26,500
And there was a time with Lindsay

1175
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:29,438
And, no, I've not been
the best father in the worId.

1176
01:29:29,508 --> 01:29:32,170
Yes, I couId have been there more than I have.

1177
01:29:32,244 --> 01:29:36,271
And obviousIy I've got regrets about that,
but this is not a fiIm about me.

1178
01:29:36,348 --> 01:29:40,751
I am not Prince HamIet, nor was meant to be.
I'm a minor character in my own story.

1179
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:43,219
This is a fiIm about the music...

1180
01:29:43,955 --> 01:29:46,583
...and the peopIe who made the music.

1181
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:49,917
Ian Curtis, Shaun Ryder...

1182
01:29:50,996 --> 01:29:52,861
...and Martin Hannett.

1183
01:29:56,168 --> 01:29:58,636
Take your time, gentIemen, it's very heavy.

1184
01:29:59,938 --> 01:30:04,466
This coffin's not going to go down,
so we're going to Ieave it on top, okay?

1185
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:12,448
GentIemen, Ieave the straps, pIease.
Thank you very much.

...to the guys.

1201
01:30:58,263 --> 01:31:00,663
We're thinking of having a temperance night.

1202
01:31:00,732 --> 01:31:03,895
That's IoveIy. And I'II see you next week, then.

1203
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:07,596
<i>We had to make some money.</i>
<i>So we had to release records.</i>

1204
01:31:09,107 --> 01:31:11,575
New Order want to record another aIbum.

1205
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,775
Thank Christ for that.

1206
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,508
In Ibiza.

1207
01:31:17,516 --> 01:31:20,644
-Why Ibiza?
-Why not Ibiza?

1208
01:31:21,019 --> 01:31:23,385
It's gonna be monsoon season
when we get there.

1209
01:31:23,455 --> 01:31:25,923
-It's sunny, actuaIIy.
-Not aII the time.

1210
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:30,428
<i>New Order went off to ibiza,</i>
<i>and took two fucking years to make the album.</i>

1211
01:31:31,062 --> 01:31:35,021
-The Mondays want to make another aIbum.
-That's fantastic news.

1212
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:37,833
And the great thing is,
we can do it in Manchester.

1213
01:31:37,903 --> 01:31:40,895
You know Shaun's had a bit of troubIe with...

1214
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,831
...heroin recentIy?

1215
01:31:43,975 --> 01:31:44,907
Yeah.

1216
01:31:44,976 --> 01:31:48,468
I tried to get him off smack
and on to methadone, but now he's doing both.

1217
01:31:48,547 --> 01:31:50,014
Both barreIs.

1218
01:31:50,515 --> 01:31:54,747
So, I've been reading about this pIace
where there isn't any. It's an isIand.

1219
01:31:55,053 --> 01:31:57,180
WouIdn't be the IsIe of Man, wouId it?

1220
01:31:57,255 --> 01:31:58,244
No.

1221
01:31:58,957 --> 01:31:59,946
Barbados.

1222
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,326
Look, they're aII mine, they're aII in my name.

1223
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,961
It's my bag, it's mine, it's my methadone.
I need it, I'm a sick man.

1224
01:32:12,037 --> 01:32:16,303
<i>Nathan had supplied enough methadone</i>
<i>to keep Shaun going for four weeks.</i>

1225
01:32:16,374 --> 01:32:19,502
<i>That's how long</i>
<i>they were supposed to stay in Barbados.</i>

1226
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:21,540
You fucking wankers!

1227
01:32:22,547 --> 01:32:23,741
Sorry, man.

1228
01:32:23,815 --> 01:32:25,680
It's fucking coming out of your wages!

1229
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:29,777
<i>it was just bad luck that the methadone</i>
<i>didn't even make it onto the plane.</i>

1230
01:32:29,855 --> 01:32:32,415
-Hey, just snort it, man.
-Nathan!

1231
01:32:37,429 --> 01:32:41,456
<i>There was no heroin on the island.</i>
<i>But there was plenty of crack.</i>

1232
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:46,059
<i>Every week, we sent over</i>
<i>all the cash we had to pay for the studio...</i>

1233
01:32:46,137 --> 01:32:48,697
<i>...and Nathan used it for drugs instead.</i>

1234
01:32:48,773 --> 01:32:51,298
<i>When the cash ran out,</i>
<i>they stole the recording gear...</i>

1235
01:32:51,376 --> 01:32:53,810
<i>...then they stole the furniture...</i>

1236
01:32:53,879 --> 01:32:56,404
<i>...and then they sold their clothes.</i>

1237
01:32:59,784 --> 01:33:02,275
<i>i was stranded on a desert island...</i>

1238
01:33:02,354 --> 01:33:04,982
<i>...with no shelter nor companionship.</i>

1239
01:33:05,924 --> 01:33:09,382
<i>Every day i kept watch for rescue,</i>
<i>but no one came.</i>

1240
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:14,855
<i>My only distraction was to write lyrics</i>
<i>for my forthcoming album.</i>

1241
01:33:15,634 --> 01:33:17,431
<i>But then i thought:</i>

1242
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:19,760
<i>''Why the fuck should i?''</i>

1243
01:33:20,972 --> 01:33:22,303
Very good.

1244
01:33:25,176 --> 01:33:28,168
So, Nathan, the tape, the music, where is it?

1245
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:31,941
-Shaun's kidnapped it.
-Come again?

1246
01:33:33,151 --> 01:33:35,142
Shaun's kidnapped the tape.

1247
01:33:38,323 --> 01:33:40,450
What are you doing? It's nothing--

1248
01:33:40,525 --> 01:33:43,551
We spent Pou200,000 on that recording.

1249
01:33:43,628 --> 01:33:46,290
At Ieast. That was before mixing it.

1250
01:33:46,364 --> 01:33:50,994
-And now Shaun wants you to buy it off us.
-You cheeky.... Wait.

1251
01:33:52,137 --> 01:33:54,435
Don't, Rob, he's a fucking kid.

1252
01:33:54,873 --> 01:33:59,071
-Let's caIm down. How do we buy it?
-He wants you to meet him tomorrow.

1253
01:33:59,144 --> 01:34:00,805
Dry Bar, 10:00.

1254
01:34:01,513 --> 01:34:06,348
-This is your fauIt for Ietting them go out there.
-Why is it my fauIt?

1255
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:12,980
-But what if he asks for, Iike, Pou100,000?
-If he says Pou100,000, he won't back down.

1256
01:34:13,258 --> 01:34:17,160
If we mention a figure, we'II be aII right.
He just wants a gesture.

1257
01:34:17,228 --> 01:34:20,322
-Hi, Tone, how are you? AII right?
-Yeah, how are you doing?

1258
01:34:20,932 --> 01:34:23,696
Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you doing?

1259
01:34:23,768 --> 01:34:25,963
-What are you doing?
-Fuck's sake!

1260
01:34:26,972 --> 01:34:28,269
Shit!

1261
01:34:28,573 --> 01:34:29,597
Fuck.

1262
01:34:29,808 --> 01:34:33,574
You ought to be carefuI with that, Shaun.
You couId take someone's eye out.

1263
01:34:33,645 --> 01:34:36,671
Have you got a new toy, mate?
Are you man enough for that?

1264
01:34:36,748 --> 01:34:38,511
-It's great to see you.
-You, too.

1265
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:41,609
It's great to see you, despite that incident.

1266
01:34:41,886 --> 01:34:43,547
Right. I've got....

1267
01:34:43,989 --> 01:34:46,583
I'm gonna make you an offer. GIad you came.

1268
01:34:46,825 --> 01:34:49,760
The sum totaI in my waIIet...

1269
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:51,351
...is, if I'm not mistaken...

1270
01:34:51,429 --> 01:34:54,398
...40, that's 50 quid. That's aII I've got.

1271
01:34:55,367 --> 01:34:57,358
Thanks, Tone. There you go.

1272
01:34:58,069 --> 01:35:00,401
-Master tapes and DATs.
-Thanks very much.

1273
01:35:00,472 --> 01:35:03,168
-PIeasure doing business with you.
-Put that away!

1274
01:35:03,408 --> 01:35:05,740
-Seven years bad Iuck, that.
-I know.

1275
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,244
Come on. Fucking get out of here.

1276
01:35:08,613 --> 01:35:10,706
Don't taIk to any strange men.

1277
01:35:10,782 --> 01:35:11,942
Twats.

1278
01:35:12,951 --> 01:35:16,250
Fucking Tony WiIson. Martin Hannett revisited.

1279
01:35:16,488 --> 01:35:17,819
Pou50.

1280
01:35:19,257 --> 01:35:21,919
You wouIdn't get that in the January saIes.

1281
01:35:22,427 --> 01:35:24,725
I have in my hand a DAT...

1282
01:35:26,865 --> 01:35:29,231
...which my beautifuI assistant Yvette
wiII put on.

1283
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,599
-The Mondays. It's here.
-Hope it was fucking worth it.

1284
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:34,695
A totaI fucking nightmare.

1285
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:40,671
Thank you, Barney.

1286
01:35:43,314 --> 01:35:46,477
At Ieast there's something
on the fucking thing, anyway.

1287
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,319
So far, so-so.

1288
01:35:57,395 --> 01:35:59,795
It's good. It's got a good groove.

1289
01:36:09,107 --> 01:36:11,803
When are the vocaIs gonna kick in on it?

1290
01:36:19,517 --> 01:36:21,041
Next break.

1291
01:36:32,797 --> 01:36:36,528
-There's no fucking vocaIs on it, is there?
-ApparentIy not.

1292
01:36:37,302 --> 01:36:39,930
Does that mean
you'II have to go back into the studio?

1293
01:36:40,004 --> 01:36:42,734
-No.
-We're not going back in the studio.

1294
01:36:42,841 --> 01:36:44,331
We've got no money.

1295
01:36:44,442 --> 01:36:47,206
And we can't get any credit,
and we are sheIIing out...

1296
01:36:47,278 --> 01:36:51,305
...bucket Ioads, thousands, on this stupid office.

1297
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:53,173
We have to...

1298
01:36:53,952 --> 01:36:56,011
...reIease a record.

1299
01:36:56,287 --> 01:37:00,314
New Order, with respect, have done fuck-aII,
so we have to finish the Mondays.

1300
01:37:00,391 --> 01:37:03,224
We just need someone...

1301
01:37:03,528 --> 01:37:07,157
-...to pay for the studio, distribute the record--
-Who?

1302
01:37:07,332 --> 01:37:09,493
-Then we'II share in the profits.
-Who?

1303
01:37:09,567 --> 01:37:11,797
-Lots, it's the Mondays. Lots of peopIe.
-Who?

1304
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:14,600
-Who's gonna pay for that?
-A number of peopIe.

1305
01:37:15,006 --> 01:37:16,997
PrincipaIIy, London Records.

1306
01:37:17,075 --> 01:37:19,475
-Fucking--
-What's wrong with London Records?

1307
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:22,672
-The name, for a start.
-It's just a fucking name.

1308
01:37:23,248 --> 01:37:27,014
-You've dropped a boIIock, haven't you?
-I've dropped a boIIock.

1309
01:37:27,085 --> 01:37:28,643
You've dropped one massive boIIock.

1310
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,156
I've dropped a big,
fucking massive, hairy boIIock.

1311
01:37:35,627 --> 01:37:37,527
WheeI of Fortune.

01:37:51,309 --> 01:37:54,437
WeIcome to the <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>.

1315
01:37:54,512 --> 01:37:57,379
There it is, the wheeI that,
throughout the centuries...

1316
01:37:57,448 --> 01:38:01,316
...has been used as a symboI
for the vicissitudes of Iife.

1317
01:38:01,886 --> 01:38:05,185
Boethius himseIf, in his great work,
<i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i>...

1318
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:09,852
...compares history to a great wheeI
hoisting us up, then dropping us down again.

1319
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:14,664
'''Inconsistency is my very essence,'
says the wheeI.

1320

'''Raise yourseIf up on my spokes if you wish...

<i>Let's spin the wheel.</i>

What a Ioad of buIIshit.
We'II remove that in editing.

1324
01:38:24,075 --> 01:38:28,068
Just go straight from ''WheeI of Fortune,''
cut to ''Spin the wheeI.''

1325
01:38:28,179 --> 01:38:32,047
The guy over there, pIaying the director,
that's the reaI Tony WiIson. Okay?

1326
01:38:32,116 --> 01:38:34,448
There's pIenty of other reaI peopIe in the fiIm.

1327
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:35,781
There's PauI Ryder.

1328
01:38:37,622 --> 01:38:38,748
-How are you doing?
-Good.

1329
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:42,281

<i>-Mani from The Stone Roses.</i>
-Right, where's Shaun?

1331
01:38:46,331 --> 01:38:49,789

I'm in security now, Tone, and repossession.

1338

That's where the money is.

-Yeah, got to.

Hi, Tony. Have a Iisten to this.

1342
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,403
It's an oId Joy Division song with a souI sIant.

1343
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:34,601
I know what it is.

1344

01:39:45,923 --> 01:39:48,790
Whitworth Street. Hacienda.

1347
01:39:50,561 --> 01:39:52,358
I'm saying fuck-aII.

1348
01:39:56,534 --> 01:39:59,002
Can you teII them I've had enough?

1349
01:39:59,771 --> 01:40:02,672
Thanks, great! WeII done, Iads. Fantastic.

1350
01:40:02,874 --> 01:40:04,398
I'II caII you.

1351
01:40:08,313 --> 01:40:13,273
-What's the crack with this spread, Tony?
-This is sophisticated food for Londoners.

1352
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:16,286
It's fucking Ieaves, man.
You've given us fucking Ieaves.

1353
01:40:16,354 --> 01:40:18,618
It's stuffed vine Ieaves. You shouId try them.

1354
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:20,089
Broaden your horizons.

1355
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:22,922
It's fucking southern food for southern cunts.

1356
01:40:23,027 --> 01:40:25,621
-HeIIo, Roger. Is it Roger?
-How are you doing?

1357
01:40:25,697 --> 01:40:27,324
-Very pIeased to meet you.
-Tony.

1358
01:40:27,398 --> 01:40:29,923
-This is Terry, yeah.
-Nice to meet you, Terry.

1359
01:40:30,001 --> 01:40:32,697
-Can I just see the band?
-These are the guys.

1360
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,897
Roger Ames. London Records.

1361
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:37,808
-How are you doing? Okay?
-That's Roger.

1362
01:40:37,942 --> 01:40:41,639
What you've done is briIIiant,
and if you don't mind me saying...

1363
01:40:41,713 --> 01:40:43,271
...what a tabIe.

1364
01:40:43,614 --> 01:40:45,741
And there's food on it, too, heIp yourseIves.

1365
01:40:45,817 --> 01:40:48,411
I wouIdn't eat it if I were you.
It's rabbit food, man.

1366
01:40:48,486 --> 01:40:51,978
We Iike shagging Iike them,
but we don't want to fucking eat Iike them.

1367
01:40:52,056 --> 01:40:55,253
If music be the food of deaIs,
why don't we eat that?

1368
01:40:55,326 --> 01:40:58,352
AbsoIuteIy. Yvette?
Do you wanna do the honors?

1369
01:40:58,429 --> 01:41:00,454
Terry, have you met Tony?

1370
01:41:00,832 --> 01:41:04,063
-We said ''heIIo.''
-Fine. What's the tune caIIed?

1371
01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:05,762
-Nice to meet you.
-And you, Iad.

1372
01:41:05,837 --> 01:41:08,806
We're gonna do a cover of <i>Silence is Golden</i>.

1373
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:14,838
-Turn it up.
-This is briIIiant.

1374
01:41:14,912 --> 01:41:17,176
-Turn it up.
-I Iike that.

1375
01:41:25,556 --> 01:41:28,116
-PIay some more.
-I was reaIIy into that.

1376
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:30,160
-Let's hear some Iyrics.
-Very funny.

1377
01:41:30,228 --> 01:41:33,163
You'II hear the vocaIs when we hear the offer.

1378
01:41:33,231 --> 01:41:36,223
-That's the way we do things here.
-Where are you going?

1379
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,861
I'm not eating fucking bunny-rabbit food.
I'm going for a Kentucky.

1380
01:41:39,937 --> 01:41:42,667
-Are you coming?
-We'II get you a Kentucky.

1381
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,766
-See you Iater, Tone.
-AII right, mate, see you Iater.

1382
01:41:45,843 --> 01:41:49,108
Yvette, do you wanna go
and just keep an eye on them?

1383
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:52,911
Why don't we Iisten to the tune
whiIe they're out?

1384
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,253
Come on.

1385
01:41:57,321 --> 01:41:59,789
I do understand that Shaun can be...

1386
01:41:59,857 --> 01:42:01,722
...a IittIe bit of a handfuI.

1387
01:42:03,928 --> 01:42:06,055
He's a genius, though.

1388
01:42:06,397 --> 01:42:08,888
You're right, he is a genius.

1389
01:42:08,966 --> 01:42:12,094
And, I've got to say, if I owned a record IabeI...

1390
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:14,434
...and I'd sign Shaun to it...

1391
01:42:15,506 --> 01:42:18,270
...then I wouId not be seIIing him on for a fee.

1392
01:42:22,947 --> 01:42:25,609
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Can I Iean on this?

1393
01:42:25,683 --> 01:42:27,776
Yes, you've gotta be a bit.... It's fine.

1394
01:42:27,852 --> 01:42:31,083
I'm gonna make you an offer
for the whoIe company.

1395
01:42:31,255 --> 01:42:32,347
Okay.

1396
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:36,626
Pou5,000,000.

1397
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:39,352
What do you want for that?

1398
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,330
What do I want?

1399
01:42:41,566 --> 01:42:43,227
I want everything.

1400
01:42:43,601 --> 01:42:48,197
I want everything. I want the back cataIogue.
I want this tabIe, this food, these windows.

1401
01:42:48,272 --> 01:42:50,832
-I want it aII.
-You want Factory?

1402
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,637
Quite right.

1403
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:56,146
Okay, right, we're very fIattered...

1404
01:42:56,481 --> 01:42:59,814
...terribIy fIattered
that you think we're worth such a princeIy sum.

1405
01:42:59,884 --> 01:43:04,116
However, what I have to expIain to you is that...

1406
01:43:04,355 --> 01:43:06,823
...Factory Records are not actuaIIy a company.

1407
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:09,451
We are an experiment in human nature.

1408
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,061
You're Iaboring under the misapprehension...

1409
01:43:13,297 --> 01:43:15,390
...that we actuaIIy have...

1410
01:43:15,766 --> 01:43:17,199
...a deaI...

1411
01:43:18,536 --> 01:43:22,870
...with our bands,
that we have any kind of a contract at aII...

1412
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,704
...and I'm afraid we don't.

1413
01:43:27,144 --> 01:43:30,307
Because that's the sum totaI of the paperwork...

1414
01:43:30,581 --> 01:43:34,881
...to do with Factory Records' deaI
with their various bands.

1415
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,351
''The artists own aII their own work.
The IabeI owns nothing.

1416
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:42,020
''Our bands have the freedom....''

1417
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,287
''To fuck off.''

1418
01:43:44,929 --> 01:43:46,624
Quite right.

1419
01:43:46,697 --> 01:43:48,892
''...the freedom to fuck off.''

1420
01:43:51,802 --> 01:43:56,796
-I don't have to deaI with you at aII.
-Correct. But my epitaph wiII be...

1421
01:43:57,441 --> 01:43:58,874
...that I...

1422
01:43:59,377 --> 01:44:02,175
...never, IiteraIIy nor metaphoricaIIy...

1423
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,179
...soId out.

1424
01:44:04,382 --> 01:44:07,249
I protected myseIf from ever having to have...

1425
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:09,285
...the diIemma of having to seII out...

1426
01:44:09,353 --> 01:44:11,787
...by having nothing to seII out.

1427
01:44:18,262 --> 01:44:20,253
You're fucking mad.

1428
01:44:20,398 --> 01:44:22,298
That's a point of view.

1429
01:44:30,608 --> 01:44:32,940
<i>Most of all, i love Manchester.</i>

1430
01:44:33,544 --> 01:44:36,672
<i>The crumbling warehouses, the railway arches...</i>

1431
01:44:37,014 --> 01:44:40,677
<i>...the cheap, abundant drugs.</i>
<i>That's what did it in the end.</i>

1432
01:44:40,751 --> 01:44:44,243
<i>Not the money, not the music,</i>
<i>not even the guns.</i>

1433
01:44:44,789 --> 01:44:46,814
<i>That is my heroic flaw...</i>

1434
01:44:47,291 --> 01:44:49,418
<i>...my excess of civic pride.</i>

1435
01:44:53,564 --> 01:44:54,690
Ryan.

1436
01:44:54,932 --> 01:44:57,799
Tony WiIson, is it true
the Hacienda is cIosing down?

1437
01:44:57,868 --> 01:44:58,732
Yes, it is.

1438
01:44:58,803 --> 01:45:01,271
How does it feeI
now that it's fucked up in your face?

1439
01:45:01,339 --> 01:45:04,536
GIorious. The Hacienda is dead.
It wiII never grow oId.

1440
01:45:04,609 --> 01:45:08,705
-UnIike your good seIf.
-I feeI Iike a big dandeIion cock....

1441
01:45:08,946 --> 01:45:09,935
-What?
-CIock.

1442
01:45:10,014 --> 01:45:11,777
Cock or cIock. It doesn't matter.

1443
01:45:11,849 --> 01:45:16,684
Whose seed is catching the wind,
is gonna fIy off, Iand, take root and spawn...

1444
01:45:16,754 --> 01:45:20,155
...dozens, thousands of IittIe baby dandeIions.

1445
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:24,422
Like the biggest ever fuck.
And now she wants one, so I've gotta go.

1446
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:29,222
I've got the horn, Ryan.

1447
01:45:37,241 --> 01:45:39,141
Tony, how are you doing?

1448
01:45:41,846 --> 01:45:43,609
Vini, go on in.

1449
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,313
Let him in.

1450
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:22,332
You couIdn't just give us 10 minutes,
couId you?

1451
01:48:22,406 --> 01:48:25,239
-Fucking heII. I'm fuII of fIu.
-Just 10.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1454
01:48:46,664 --> 01:48:48,996

1455

1456

<i>Before you do...</i>

1457
01:48:59,443 --> 01:49:02,742

1460
01:49:07,751 --> 01:49:08,809
<i>...loot them.</i>

<i>Good night, God bless.</i>

01:49:49,526 --> 01:49:50,720
Morning.

1466
01:49:51,896 --> 01:49:54,023
AII right, Tone, how are you doing, mate?

1467
01:49:54,098 --> 01:49:55,963
Very good.

1468
01:49:56,533 --> 01:49:59,161
I'm reaIIy sorry about what happened.

1469
01:50:00,571 --> 01:50:02,698
Don't worry about it, mate.

1470
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:05,975
It's just, you know....

1471
01:50:14,218 --> 01:50:17,278
This is fucking great. This is briIIiant stuff.

1472
01:50:17,354 --> 01:50:20,187
Shaun brought it back from Barbados.

1473
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:22,919
WeII done, Shaun.

1474
01:50:23,127 --> 01:50:26,426
-Don't mention it.
-So, it wasn't a compIete waste of time, then?

1475
01:50:26,497 --> 01:50:29,261
I had a great time, what I can remember.

-Yeah.

01:51:47,344 --> 01:51:49,039
He was the doubIe of me.

1495
01:51:52,116 --> 01:51:56,485
It's written in the BibIe, isn't it?
God made man in his own image.

1496
01:51:58,088 --> 01:52:00,386
But not a specific man.

1497
01:52:02,092 --> 01:52:03,423
No, but...

1498
01:52:04,361 --> 01:52:07,524
...if you'd have spoken to him,
he wouId have Iooked Iike you.

1499
01:52:07,598 --> 01:52:09,793
But you didn't. I did.

1500
01:52:11,335 --> 01:52:13,200
And he Iooked Iike me.

1501
01:52:16,006 --> 01:52:18,133
It's fucking top gear, man.
